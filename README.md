# 2^3 Factorial Experiments on Students' Performance

### -- Project Status: [Active, On-Hold, Completed]
## Project intro/objective
Academic success affects a child's self esteem and motivations. It can also be an early indicator of a child's pursuit for higher education. In Nigeria, most parents are of the opinion that private secondary schools are a better choice for their child's academic development than the public ones. Over the years, this situation has drastically increased enrollment into the private schools.


Using a 2^3 full factorial design , this project aims to investigate the effects of School, Gender, and Specialization on students' performance

### Methods Used

* Factorial Experiment 

* Data Visualization

* Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) 

* Hypothesis testing

### Technologies

* Python
* Excel
* Pandas, Statmodels, & Math
* JupyterLab

## Project Description
The WAEC results of 140  students (70F, 70M) from 2 schools were used for this project. Performance was gauged by coding the grades in Maths + English language using nine points item scale; A1 to F9 (A1=8, B2=7, B3=6, C4=5, C5=4, C6=3, D7=2, E8=1, F9=0). The data was analyzed using main/interaction effect plots, full factorial model with 3 factors, ANOVA table and Hypothesis testing.

## Needs of this project
* data scientist/analyst
* experimenter looking for information with low cost
* data exploration/inferential statistics
* statistical analysis

## Key Findings

* In the maths + english exam, the private school had a positively large effect on the students' performance. Although, the students'
gender or specialization (humanities to science) had no signficant influence on their test score regardless of school type.

* Meanwhile in the maths exam, the combination effect of School and Specialization had significant influence on the students' performance.

### Threats to the Validity of this Experiment:

* There was no randomization in the selection of the two participating schools.

* Cases of exam malpractice or cheating might have influenced the results.

* The label "Humanities" is a combination of two classes: the "Commercial" and "Arts" classes.

* The data has uneven distribution of students in Science (=81) and Humanities(=59)
