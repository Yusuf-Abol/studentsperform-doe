# 2^3 Factorial Experiments on Students' Performance
## Project Overview
Academic success affects a child's self esteem and motivations. It can also be an early indicator of a child's pursuit for higher education. In Nigeria, parents often prefer private secondary schools over public ones, driving increased enrollment. This project aims to find out whether factors like:
* School
* Gender, and
* Specialization

influences academic performance.
## Objectives
* Examine individual factors and their interactions on academic performance.
* Screen factors in our investigation with the smallest number of runs.
* To help policymakers and stakeholders in making improvements in the sector by providing information at a lower cost.


## Dataset
